## Setup

NodeJS and MySQL are required to run the server.

- After configuring the MySQL server, run `createTables.sql` file to create the tables. (can be run on MySQL Workbench)
- Copy the template.env file and rename the copy as '.env'.
- Write your MySQL password and username in .env.
- Change mysql port and database if they are different in your computer. The values in the template are default values and you probably don't need to change them.
- Run `npm install` to install required packages.
- Finally type `node server.js` to start the server.
